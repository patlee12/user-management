## User Management

This Nest.js application provides a scalable, secure backend solution for user management and authentication. It includes user login, JWT-based authentication, Multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based authorization, user profile management, and integration with Nginx (Reverse Proxy) and Avahi (MDNS) for service discovery. This application is designed to be a boilerplate for projects requiring user account login architecture, and can be easily integrated into other projects for rapid deployment of secure user management features.

I've included a swagger module for endpoint testing. Once the project is served go to https://user-management.local/api (see section "Running the App in a Production Environment" for setup)

## Dependencies:

1. Node v22.13.1
2. Yarn version v1.22.22
3. Docker

## Create .env file in root directory (Required!)

Template for environment file, please copy the below template and add it to a .env file in the root level of project repository. Also, please generate all your own passwords and secrets (replace generic passwords like "adminpassword") by following the instructions in the comments.

```bash
# Make your own passwords!! Use open SSL to generate your own secret.
# ie. open terminal and type: openssl rand -base64 32

## Postgres
POSTGRES_USER="admin"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="mypassword"
POSTGRES_DB="hive-db"

DATABASE_URL="postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}"
DATABASE_URL_PROD="postgresql://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}"

## Nginx
NGINX_HOST="user-management.local"
NGINX_PROXY="nestjs:3000"

## Avahi
AVAHI_START_DAEMON="true"
DISABLE_SYSTEMD="true"
AVAHI_HOSTNAME="user-management"


## User-Management (Nest.js)

# Make your own passwords!! Use open SSL to generate your own secret.
# ie. open terminal and type: openssl rand -base64 32

JWT_SECRET=""

# Development or Production
NODE_ENV ="Production"

# Turn on swagger module (For endpoint Testing) Recommend to disable this in a production deployment.
ENABLE_SWAGGER ='true'

# Stage Production Environment only set to true for first run in production.
STAGING_PRODUCTION="true"

# Admin Email
ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@user-management.net"

# Admin password openssl rand -base64 32.
ADMIN_PASSWORD = ""

# Mfa Encryption Key openssl rand -hex 32.
MFA_KEY=""
```

## Running the App in a Production Environment

It is recommended to test the project locally using docker before running it in an official production environment. You also may want to update the run-admin-seed.ts file with specifics related to your project if you have been developing new database models etc.

(Reminder: update all passwords in the .env file)

# Create certs for Nginx

This project uses Nginx as a reverse proxy to handle all incoming connections. Before running Docker, ensure that the Nginx configuration paths are correctly set for your environment. Since all traffic is routed through Nginx, a valid SSL certificate is requiredâ€”be sure to monitor its expiration to prevent service disruptions.

```bash
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout ./certs/nginx-selfsigned.key \
  -out ./certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```

# Install Dependencies and Run App in Docker

If you don't want to use "user-management.local" as hostname you can set a host-name in avahi-config and update the .env variable.

```bash
# Install dependencies.
$ yarn install

# Run the project with docker:
$ docker compose up --build

# Keep it running in background by adding the -d flag.
$ docker compose up -d
```

Give the containers a minute to complete deployment. The Nest.js app will be the last one finished deploying. Then open a browser and go to https://user-management.local/api

## Avahi Tips

Sometimes if you re-start the project a few times in a short period, Avahi can have hostname conflicts. Avahi will automatically resolve it and give you a host name, you just might have to scroll up or check the logs or directly by opening another terminal and typing `docker logs avahi`.

# Docker tips

If a container gets stuck (sometimes needs a reboot). See example below and first run `docker ps ` to find your container:

```bash
sudo docker stop user-management-pgweb-1
sudo docker rm user-management-pgweb-1
sudo docker stop $(sudo docker ps -q)

sudo docker rm -f user-management-pgweb-1


sudo docker inspect --format '{{.State.Pid}}' user-management-pgweb-1
sudo kill -9 <PID>
sudo docker rm user-management-pgweb-1

# Remove volumes and Rebuild.
# (Warning: Removes database!!! if you include volumes)
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans



```

## Running the app in Development Environment

First make sure to go to .env file and change `NODE_ENV ='Development'` and also make sure `ENABLE_SWAGGER ='true'` if it isn't.

```bash
# Install dependencies.
$ yarn install

#Setup Prisma ORM.
$ yarn prisma generate

# Run the docker-compose-development.yml which serves postgres and adminer.
$ docker compose -f docker-compose-development.yml up --build

# Need to run postgres container for this to work.
$ yarn prisma migrate dev

#If you want to seed the db with dummy data.
$ yarn prisma db seed

# development.
$ yarn start

# build.
$ yarn build

# production mode.
$ yarn start:prod
```

# Using Adminer DB tool

(Development)
After development container environment is running http://localhost:8081

(Production)
After production container environment is running
https://user-management.local/adminer

Assuming you have this in your .env file:

```bash
## Postgres
POSTGRES_USER="admin"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="mypassword"
POSTGRES_DB="hive-db"
```

1. Select PostgreSQL
2. Username: admin
3. password: mypassword
4. Database: hive-db

## Test

```bash
# unit tests.
$ yarn test

# e2e tests.
$ yarn test:e2e

# test coverage.
$ yarn test:cov
```
